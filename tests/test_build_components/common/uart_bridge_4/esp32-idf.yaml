# Common configuration for 4-channel UART bridge/expander chips
# Used by components like wk2168, wk2204, wk2212 that create 4 UART channels
# Defines standardized UART IDs: uart_id_0, uart_id_1, uart_id_2, uart_id_3

substitutions:
  # These will be overridden by component-specific values
  uart_bridge_address: "0x70"

# Note: The actual UART instances are created by the bridge component
# This package just ensures all bridge components use the same ID naming convention
# so they can be grouped together without conflicts
